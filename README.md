# Sardes
The idea behind this project was to leverage some of the emerging UAV-photogrammetry datasets to generate a scene that can be used within unity games. I chose Sardes because my amazing girlfriend spent summer 2016 there working in their active archaeological conservation lab. Also, I found this pretty legit model of her site online: [Sardes](https://sketchfab.com/models/b5cb981266de442085f8b697c9a2922c)

My original goal was to transform the daily mundane struggles from her summer into a silly game. I didn't get too far, but it is still fun to explore the site using Ethan, Unity's most basic prefab. Maybe someday I will return to expand some of the levels.
